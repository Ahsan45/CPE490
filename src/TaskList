Things to add to project:
  -Broadcast to all when a user has left
  -Add commands (so messages that begin with '/' are treated differently)
  -Alternate way to disconnect other than exiting (say like typing a command "/disconnect" in the client)
  -Timestamps with each message [COMPLETE]
  -Whisper to specific user functionality
  -User list (command "/users")
